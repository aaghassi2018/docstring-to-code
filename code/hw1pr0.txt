The article states that, whether in science or business, we "don't have to settle for models at all." Do you agree or disagree with this statement? How? And why? Certainly feel free to articulate a more nuanced or hybrid view, if you'd like.

	I disagree with this extreme view of thinking that explains that we simply do not need models. Rather, I believe that in some cases, perhaps we can ease on the strict scientific idea that we cannot get to conclusions on the bases of correlation. I do not believe that in all cases of business and science we can be completely oblivious to models and simply take the data and make conclusions. This way of thinking is not scientific at all. Instead, we can use a mixture of both: use models, but also take the fact that we have petabytes of data that we can use together to come to conclusions.
