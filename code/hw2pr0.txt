To what extent do artificial languages (such as Python or Picobot) have the ability to shape human thought, if at all? Or are such languages fundamentally different from human ones, such as Guugu Yimithirr and English?

I believe that artificial languages, like computer languages we code in, absolutely shape human thought in a way. When we think about how to tell a computer to do a certain task, we think in a completely different way than if we were thinking about telling a friend to do a certain task. Of course, when we are planning the logic and structure of the program, we think in our native language like English or whatever it might be; however, the way we are thinking about it is not exactly the same as if we were telling a friend to do the same task. This is a fundamental difference which leads me to believe that artificial languages do shape human thought.
