Explanation of "Extension" for our C4 Project:

We did: Option #2: Static board evaluation in AI 

For our static board evaluation, we considered three primary factors:
1) the priority the player in question had in the middle 3 columns over the other player
2) the number of 2-in-a-row runs versus the opponents number of 2-in-a-row runs.
3) the same for the unblocked 3-in-a-row runs

After computing each of these factors, we weighted them, coming to one score for the board.



To play, in the command prompt, run the following:

In [1]: px = Player('X', 'RANDOM', 3)
In [2]: b = Board(7, 6)
In [3]: b.playGame(px, 'human')

Then, either choose to play without the Static board evaluation (Option 0), or with the Static board evaluation (Option 1)

Have fun!!
