1. Are we actually in a simulation? Yes? No? Maybe...? Why do you think so (or not)?

2. If we were, in fact, in a simulation, would that change your view of our world? How (or not)?

I do not think we are in a computer simulation just because of the fact that there is no evidence for the fact that we are in a simulation. A person with an opposing opinion will say that there is no evidence against the fact that we are in a simulation, but I do not believe that this is the correct way to think. By that logic, you can be rational in believing anything without evidence for or against it. Some people think this is a rational way to think, but I would disagree. 
Moreover, if we were in a simulation, I do not think I would change my view of our world. There is nothing different about how I would live my life if I knew it was some simulation. To us, everything would be the same whether or not we were in a simulation.
