What is an application that (in your opinion) Watson's technology might be able to contribute to? Alternatively, do you feel Watson's capabilities will not make much of an impact? You can look around for web articles on this, or you're welcome to speculate.

I think Watson's technology will be able to contribute to quite a bit. Anything that seems like it could be done based on previous tasks, I believe a computer will be able to accomplish one day. Anything service related, driving, even answering phone calls and organizing paper. These kinds of jobs that are done based on previous tasks, I believe that computers like Watson will one day be able to do. However, there are certain things that I find it hard to believe artificial intelligence can make an impact on. For example, new diseases that are discovered. It is hard to imagine that a computer will be able to encounter and discover things that have absolutely never been seen before; however, technology continues to surprise us, so it certainly can be done.
